# SPS30 Particle Sensor

SPS30 is a new particle sensor from Sensirion AG.

This is a simple test driver for UART mode and Windows.

You will need a 5 pin 'ZHR-5' connector for the sensor (1.5mm pin spacing).
Often the components (housing and pre crimped cables) are easier to get than complete cables:
- Housing ZHR-5
- Cables ASZHSZH28K152 

Best is to connect the sensor to an USB UART.
Power consumtion is about 5 mA in stop mode and 50mA active.
Sensor needs 5V, the I/Os are 3.3/5V tolerant.
